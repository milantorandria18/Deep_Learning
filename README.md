# Deep_Learning
Project in deep learning course

In this project, we aspire to generate texts that closely resemble those written by Shakespeare, utilizing a neural network model. We will leverage a body of text authored by Shakespeare as our primary resource to train the model, allowing it to learn the intricacies of Shakespearean writing.

Upon the project's completion, our model is anticipated to demonstrate proficiency in generating texts that emulate Shakespeare's style, evoking one or more of his distinctive linguistic elements.
